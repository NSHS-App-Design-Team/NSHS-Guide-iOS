#Things to remember#
* before starting every day, pull the new changes usingXcode (NOT Sourcetree)
* after editing a bit of your code, commit your changes
* remember to give your commits a nice description so you know what you did
* when you're all done editing, push your changes back to here so everyone can see (again, using Xcode)
